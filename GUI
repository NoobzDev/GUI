# GUI
Roblox GUI for our game (Loading Screen)

under starter gui add screen gui
add a frame to the screen gui and make it as large as the screen (manually (1,0) (1,0)
add a text button (PLAY!)
add a text label (NoobzNoobz's Difficulty Chart Obby!)
background transparency to the text label = 1
under starter gui insert a local script
name frame "Screen"
name text button "Play"
(COPY THE SCRIPT BELOW THAT I MADE)

local Screen = script.Parent.Screen
local PlayButton = Screen.Play

PlayButton.Activated:Connect(function()
  script.Parent.Screen:TweenPosition(UDim2.new(0, 0, -1, 0), "In","Quart")
  wait(1)
  script.Parent:Destroy()
end)
